# Memory Matching Game (C# Console Application)

## Overview

This project is an **interactive Memory Matching Game** developed in **C#** within the .NET Console environment. The game features a 3x2 grid of randomly shuffled letter pairs. Players select two cards per turn to find matching pairs. Correct matches remain revealed, while mismatches flip back after a timed pause. The game tracks total wins and allows players to replay or exit at any time.

## Key Technologies & Concepts

- **C#** for core game logic and control flow  
- Console input/output for interactive user experience  
- Threading to implement timed pauses, enhancing gameplay feedback  
- Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm to randomize card positions effectively  

## Why This Matters

This project strengthened foundational programming skills critical for backend development and API design, including:

- Managing and updating game state efficiently  
- Handling synchronous user input in a console environment  
- Implementing clean, modular, and structured logic  
- Applying algorithms (Fisher-Yates shuffle) for randomness  

These competencies translate well into designing robust backend systems and interactive command-line tools.

## Features

- 3x2 grid of letter pairs shuffled randomly each game  
- Players select two cards per turn to find matches  
- Correct matches stay revealed; mismatches flip back after a brief pause  
- Tracks total wins across game sessions  
- Options to replay or exit the game at any time  

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- .NET SDK installed (compatible with your system)  
- Basic knowledge of C# programming  

### Running the Game

1. Clone the repository:
2. Navigate to the project directory:
3. Build and run the console application:
4. Follow on-screen prompts to play the game.


## What I Learned

- Designing and managing game state in a console application  
- Handling user input and output for interactive gameplay  
- Using threading to create timed delays for better UX  
- Implementing classic algorithms like Fisher-Yates shuffle
